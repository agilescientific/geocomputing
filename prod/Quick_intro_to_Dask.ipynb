    "\n",
    "**Dask** is a very popular library for parallel and distributed computing in Python. It has two components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic task scheduling** optimized for computation. This is similar to [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/), Luigi, Celery, or Make, but optimized for interactive computational workloads.\n",
    "- **Large data structures** like NumPy arrays (Dask Array), Pandas dataframes (Dask DataFrame), and Python lists (Dask Bag — similar to PySpark) that work on larger-than-memory or distributed environments. These parallel collections run on top of dynamic task schedulers.\n",
